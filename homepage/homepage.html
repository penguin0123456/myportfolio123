        <div class="texttitle"> <h2> About Me: </h2> </div>
        <div class="aboutmetext" >
                <p> Hello! I am Connor Zeng, and I am from Hong Kong. I am currently 16 years old, attending CDNIS (Canadian International School of Hong Kong)
                    I am passionate about guitar and writing music. </p> </ul> </div>
        <div class="texttitle"> <h2> Skills and Passions: </h2> </div>
        <div class="hobbiestext"> <p> 
            I play guitar and drums in various rock, jazz, and metal bands. I also post my guitar playing on social media, having emassed a small following. 
            I enjoy reading as well as watching movies. Last but not least, I love coding, and am proficient in HTML and CSS. (This portfolio was entirely hand-coded using these languages!) <br> </p>
        </div>

        <div class="texttitle"> <h2> My Experience: </h2> </div>
        <div class="favmusictext"> <p>  
            I am involved in the local underground diy music scene, having connected with diy show organisers such as 
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theundergroundhk/"> The Underground</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rice.hk/"> rice.hk</a>, 
            and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/milkteawithoutmilk/"> milkteawithoutmilk.</a> 
            I have played shows at local venues such as <a href="/blogs/blogshomepage.html#blogapril14title">The Wanch</a>, 
            <a href="/myportfolio123/blogs/blogshomepage.html#blogapril12title">The Aftermath</a>, and <a href="/myportfolio123/blogs/blogshomepage.html#blogapril13title">Kon-Fusion</a>, , as well as in international schools
            such as <a href="/myportfolio123/blogs/blogshomepage.html#blogapril11title">ISF</a>, <a href="/myportfolio123/blogs/blogshomepage.html#blogapri10title">CIS</a>, and <a href="/myportfolio123/blogs/blogshomepage.html#blogapril15title">CDNIS</a>.
            Furthermore, I achieved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HQoPTWhaMY"> 
                first place in the Tom Lee Guitar Festival youth category </a> winning 10,000 HKD in tom lee vouchers.

        <div class="iblearner"> <h2> My IB Learner Profiles Traits: </h2>
            <p> I display the IB learner traits of communicator and risk taker. This is shown by my 
                involvement in the local DIY underground music scene. Connecting and talking 
                with organisers and people in the scene is very 
                intimidating at first, and it took great risk taking skills in order to approach them, but once
                I realized they were friendly and nice, I became acquaintances with them, often chatting about the local scene, tips on getting gigs, music recommendations etc. 
                These promoters often invited us to play small underground shows. <br> <br> I also display the IB learner traits of Inquiry. I am
                eternally curious and willing to learn new things, constantly picking up new hobbies. An example of this is coding. I picked up 
                coding as a hobby, making little personal websites and blogs using html and css, completely out of curiosity and the want to create interesting and creative things. I constantly inquired
                about HTML and CSS syntax, practicing and creating little projects everyday until I was completely comfortable using these languages to code. After just 
                1 month of learning HTML and CSS, I am confident in coding simple webpages and apps using these languages, including this portfolio site.
